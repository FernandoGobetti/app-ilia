Hello, I am a PHP programmer with over five years of experience. Throughout the years, I have honed my skills in PHP and gained a deep understanding of the WordPress, Laravel, and proprietary software ecosystems.

I have experience with popular PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Zend Framework, as well as another CMS for E-commerce, Magento.

In addition to PHP, I also have knowledge in HTML 5, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, JAVA, Springboot, React JS, and React-Native.

I am also familiar with relational databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
